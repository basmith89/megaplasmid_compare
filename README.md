# Megaplasmid Compare

This repository serves as a holding area for the scripts used in the publication "[Just the Two of Us? A Family of Pseudomonas Megaplasmids Offers a Rare Glimpse into the Evolution of Large Mobile Elements](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/11/4/1192/5421171)" where this software was used to identify the origin of replication as well as parse and edit sequence and annotation data.


This repository is still under construction and will soon include walk throughs of data visualization and figure data.
